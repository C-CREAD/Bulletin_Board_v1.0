## Description
This project is a Django web application designed for users to interact with posts on a bulletin board. The application contains features that allow the user to send, edit/update, and delete posts for other users to see and interact with.

This application will run on Python, using the Django framework to host the web application. The webpages are designed with HTML & CSS (along with some Bootstrap)

To stop the application, you need to find the container ID of the docker image running. To get this container ID, enter this command:
```shell

```

You should see this output on the terminal:
```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                           COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                    NAMES

```

Copy the container ID, then enter this command 'docker stop', followed by the container ID you just copied:
```shell
docker stop xxxxxx
```
The terminal should output the same  container ID you copied, showing that the project has closed successfully.
